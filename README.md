# MD-playground: A Minimal Molecular Dynamics Engine in Python

## About
MD-playground is a Python-based molecular dynamics (MD) simulation engine designed for simplicity and extensibility. The engine is capable of simulating:
- Single particles in harmonic or double-well potentials.
- Systems of particles interacting via Lennard-Jones or other potentials.
- Enhanced sampling techniques using Metadynamics.

## Features
- **Integrators**: Velocity Verlet.
- **Thermostats**: Optional control of temperature.
- **Potentials**: Harmonic, double-well, Lennard-Jones, and more.
- **Enhanced Sampling**: Metadynamics.
- **1D, 2D, 3D Simulations**: Flexibility to handle systems in different dimensions.

## Getting Started
### Installation
